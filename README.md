#  EXCALIBUR
## By Olivia Akinyi Adongo

## Introduction
Super Smash Bros is a crossover action packed game filled with characters that most people would recognize and more characters have been added overtime. these characters include Mario, Pichu who is a clone of Pikachu, Princess Zelda, Sonic and so many more. Most games have guides on techniques needed to play in the game. 

## Description
The objective of this web application is to give easier acces to a user to check the guide to techniques by just clicking a button to view techniques they can use in the Super Smash Bros game and the controls they can use to achieve these techniques. 

## Phases
I created HTML, CSS, Javascript, README and license files. I first set up the basic layout of the page that was to be displayed using HTML then styled it using CSS. I then used JavaSript to add eventd to the ellements in the html page.

## Instructions
Once the user opens the application they are able to see the name of the application "Excalibur" and some text beneath it "Super Smash Bros Guide". Below that there is a button that allows them to click which upon clicking a pop up window will be displayed containing a list of techniques used in the Super Smash Bros game. 
After viewing the list the user can close the pop up window with a close button located at the bottom of that window.
